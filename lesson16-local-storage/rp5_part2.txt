Explaination:
1. Room Temperature : At room's temperature, the reaction occurs with the normal conditions.
2. 50 + 90 : When increasing the temperature, the atoms and molecules of reactants are provided more energy so they move faster and increase the collision among them. Therefor, the higher temperature the reaction rate is higher and less time is consumed.

Comment: After the above experiment, we can conclude about the factor affection reaction rate. The higher temperature is, the faster of reaction occurs.
